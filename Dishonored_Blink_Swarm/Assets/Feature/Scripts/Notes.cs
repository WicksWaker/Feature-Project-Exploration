    ///1. need to finish powers- both need to be singletons
    ///2. Enemy movement needs to be done & needs to be able to shrink in size until inactive
    ///also probably needs a list, also needs to interpolate to rats
    ///3. Blink needs to be able to move
    ///4. Swarm- instead of spawn, just jump- 
    ///thinking it might be better if they were already in the scene
    ///and simply SetActive() & jump, will need a list to keep track of
    ///active and inactive rats, will need to Boid
    ///5. Player needs to be able to rotate via mouse (so camera can do so too)
    ///6. Health needs to be shown- text based or bar w/ increase/ decrease scale (blue cube that increases and decreases on the y axis)
